highlights: >
    Fixed a serialization issue in `SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker` where
    document scores were returned as `numpy.float32` instead of standard Python `float`.
    This ensures better compatibility with tools relying on JSON serialization (e.g. Hayhooks).

fixes:

    Ensure that the `score` field in `SentenceTransformersSimilarityRanker` is
    returned as a Python `float` instead of `numpy.float32`. This prevents potential
    serialization issues in downstream integrations.
